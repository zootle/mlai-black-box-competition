## Bayesian Optimisation for Black Box Functions

### Project Overview

This project was part of a competition aimed at optimizing 8 black box functions using Bayesian Optimization over a period of 12 weeks. The code was submitted at the end of the competition, after the results had been evaluated.

The code revolves around utilizing scikit-learn's GaussianProcessRegressor, coupled with Optuna 
for hyperparameter tuning, and Dask for parallel processing across a cluster.
